                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The objective of this project was to create a better all-round system that caters to users on the go. To help users save more on a day-to-day basis. The word budgeting has become hated by many because the first thought that comes to mind is limited spending or manually calculating expenses. It is a very tedious task that involves a lot of willpower and time that most users will not commit to.

                    This is the first product design I have compiled and I learned a lot from it. From time management all the way up to the fundamentals of the required tools to perform the job. This project has been a great overall well-rounded learning experience.

                            The expansion is very lightweight component as its goal is to provide users with a quick overview of spending habits. Its learning curve is very low so all age variants can pick up on it easily.

                        Next I took a look at many competitors in the world of budget tech (Mint, Wally, Level Money, GoodBudget, etc). From that picked pieces that were necessary and striped components that weren't.

                    <p>
                        To start I created a very general design based on our users needs and wants, a potential system that would help benefit their life all while not disturbing their day-to-day activities. I layed out cored components and organized them based on preliminary validation and feedback from real users. This really helped me narrow down my solution for when I jumped into the Hi-Fidelity prototyping stage.

                    <p>
                        The framework which is designed around notification systems. They play a vital role as a companion to the myBudget system, the concept being that users are not obligated to tap into the notifications but they serve as reminder. Flexible so that users do not feel pressured to tap, they can simply swipe away or ignore them - either way the purpose use has been fulfilled.

                <h1>Notification system:</h1>
                    <p>
                       The core flex of this design is built around notifications. The concept that each notification is built with the intention to either, 1) Lead them into viewing their spendings, 2) Remind them of their spendings. 
                    </p>
                <div class="notifications"></div>
                
                <h1>Payment notification:</h1>
                    <p>
                        The new notification displays all pre-existing information with the new addition at the bottom. Apple pay notifications pull information from your actual banking application, they display what card was used, the establishment name and amount spent. I thought it would be more intuitive to include a small line to help users align their expenses without the need for excessive amount of information. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those establishments that do not accept Apple pay or if the user simply choses to use their credit card, the app will pull information from the spending history and users will receive the same type of notification. Thus, they are not missing out by not opting to use Apple pay.
                    </p>
                <div class="payment"></div>
                
                <h1>Budget reminder notification:</h1>
                    <p>
                        For those who still carry around cash, this notification was designed to remind users every so often to fill their budget tracker with cash transactions made in the past few days (depending on their reoccurrence preferences i.e. “Every 2 days”). Once it prompts, it opens up the app to the sign-on page and leads users to the overlay where they can input values: Establishment, Category & Amount.
                    </p>
                <div class="budget-reminder"></div>
                
                <h1>Budget warning notification:</h1>
                    <p>
                        It is vital to remind ourselves when we are approaching our budget limits. Due to the increased amount of payment methods that exist today, it can become easy to lose track of our spendings. Often when we try to stay on budget, we find ourselves off budget. Once it prompts, it opens the app to the sign-on page and redirects users to the main screen of the component, where it then opens the weekly break down overlay.
                    </p>
                <div class="budget-warning"></div>
                
                <h1>Completed savings goal notification:</h1>
                    <p>
                        These screens were built around the intention of helping users save their money. Whether they own a savings account or don’t, they can always open one as suggested. Long term goals are made easier with the help of this small addition to the app; automation takes the headaches out of manually calculating numbers and a more simplified method of saving is achieved.
                    </p>

                <h1>With a savings account</h1>
                    <p>
                        If user has a pre-existing savings account, it will prompt if they want to deposit it into the account

                        With the help of notifications, users will be able to keep track of their spendings much faster. The integrated myBudget system removes the need to download unnecessary applications from third party vendors which gives rise to security risks.
