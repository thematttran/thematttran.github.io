                    A bit of background on how this project came to be, one morning as I was going for my morning coffee and paid for my drink using Apple-pay but I realized that the receipt didn't display much information asides from where I spent my money/how much. I thought to myself, how would this change If I added one more line that tracked my finances because after all a coffee a day really does add up. I chose to work with the <a href="https://www.cibc.com/en/personal-banking/ways-to-bank/mobile-services.html?utrc=S186:2&s_kwcid=AL!4740!3!223152534389!b!!g!!%2Bcibc%20%2Bmobile%20banking&ef_id=WfUf3AAAAGPTOVbn:20180124235001:s" target="_blank">CIBC Banking App</a> because at the time of this casestudy I was working there as a quality assurance agent. It was a great starting point for a first design as I was well acquinted with how the company functioned/designs were layed out. 
                    <br><br>
                    Diving into the project I wanted to create a better all-round system that caters to people on the go. To help them save more on a day-to-day basis. These days the word budgeting has become hated by many because the first thought that comes to mind is 'limited spending' or 'manually calculating expenses' and has become a very tedious task that involves a lot of willpower/time that most will not commit to. The expansion is a very lightweight component as its goal is to provide people with a quick overview of spending habits. I tried to minimize the complexity of the interface so that the learning curve is low and all age variants can pick up the app and use it easily.

                    To better understand who I am designing for, I began research by collecting data from two different age demographics which were adults (working/non-working) and post-secondary students. Narrowing down the data from my research the main demographic looking to save more were the adults. They are looking to further their future finances all while not compromising their standard of living. From there I did a final compilation of the data and created a persona and job story so that I could better emphathesize/understand their motivation and desired outcomes.

                <p>I looked at many competitors in the world of budget tech (Mint, Wally, Level Money, GoodBudget, etc). I needed a basis to work from since I have not specifically built a service that caters ones financial needs, so from those already existing applications I picked pieces that fit Josephs criteria of needs and built a better solution.

                    Starting off I created rough sketches to help myself conceptualize an idea, once solidified to better visualize how Joseph would use the implimentation I created a Userflow and mapped out all possible scenarios. Without going into further detail in this section, the userflow is based on the core component of my concept which is notifications. They play a vital role being that he will not feel obligated to tap into said notifications but they serve as reminder to him about the main component. This creates enough flexiblity so that he does not feel pressured to tap but can simply swipe away or ignore them - either way the purposed use has been fulfilled.

                    After having completed the design in sketch, I did a round of testing with "Joseph" and allowed him to look at the product. I recieved his input for a v2 design which were minor interface changes but overall the feedback was pretty positive and he said he would be interested in using this over Mint (Mission success!).

                    With the help of this system (Saving mechanisms + Notifications), Joseph will now be able to keep track of his spendings on a day-to-day basis rather than an annual basis. The design removes the need to download unnecessary applications from third party vendors such as mint who require you to input your banking information which create security risks (although proven to be secure there are chances of your banking information leaking).

                    This is the first case study I have compiled and gained much insight from it. Starting from scratch not knowing where to begin, I studied indepth the industry standard tools to help me design. Now with my newly acquired knowledge I am ready to move onto the next project to further increase my design thinking capabilities, I will revisit this project in the near future for a v2 iteration but for now onto the next. Thanks for reading!
