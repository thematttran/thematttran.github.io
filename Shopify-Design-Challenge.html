                    The task presented to us designers was to create a new digital service that will help people understand how their daily choices have an impact on their environment and how to make it easier for them to log their information every day to help them make better life decisions. The brief was ambiguous, not much to work except but these are my favorite kind of challenges. The greater the hurdle, you will always gain something from it whether you manage to clear it the first time or fall face flat what you will learn from that failure is irreplaceable.

                The issue I decided to tackle with this design challenge was recycling as the title of this page suggests. Different form of recyclable products can cause harm to the environment if not dealt with properly. E-waste forms toxic chemicals which is detrimental to the environment or textile waste from last season’s line of clothing adding up to billions of pounds being put into landfills. These are only two examples of consumer products causing damage to the environment but there are much more.

                <p>There have been many approaches to tackle recycling. This is a global problem that has been affecting our planet for many years and it only continues to grow each and every day. The question I ask myself is how can I even attempt to solve such a big problem that has been passed down through generations of consumerism.

                    I look to solve the issue by seeking collaboration with giant companies that already offer trade-in programs to their customers. Many stores offer trade-in reward programs to their customers in which they can gain discounts on future products in the form of vouchers ($5 cash back or 10% discount). By creating a service that amplifies the rewards you gain from these trade-in programs you create a bigger incentive for consumers to recycle more. Its no secret that these corporations using your old recycled products to create new products due to the attractive low cost of re-using old material so by having consumers provide more recyclables at a higher rate this would be beneficial to them as they would be gaining more material to produce more goods. Overall for companies they will be gaining more in the long run by creating a stronger culture of collective values with their customer base and they will return to purchase more goods because you share the same ideals but in the end its a win for both sides.

                    Diving more into the app design, I have named it Dirty Money. It is a game centered around the concept of recycling where people can compete with their friends/family or globally and in turn they will gain points called Dirty Money (hence the name) in which they spend towards vouchers which are applicable to partnered companies. You maybe asking why a game and how does this create more awareness? The short answer because games are fun and it doesn't create immediate awareness but as users participate in the game they will be inherently recycling more, getting rid of those old phones they have been holding onto for years or those old style of clothes that may comeback in fashion.

                    What I achieve to aim with this service, to get people in the habit of recycling their old products to further reduce future waste, there is a value in your garbage and you should get more back from what you’ve spent. Recycling doesn’t have to be a chore it can be fun, by placing a twist of competition it can really motivate people to do more (plus rewards are always nice!). From a company perspective, not everything should be gained in the form of profits, by creating a deeper connection with your consumer base you will gain more in the long run (return customers = more profits). Thanks for reading!
